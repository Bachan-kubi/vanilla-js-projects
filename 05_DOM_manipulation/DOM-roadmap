ðŸŒ± Phase 1: Fundamentals (Beginner)

ðŸ‘‰ Goal: Understand what the DOM is and how to interact with it.

What is the DOM?

Relationship between HTML, CSS, and JS.

DOM tree: nodes, elements, attributes, text.

document object.

Selecting Elements

getElementById, getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName.

querySelector, querySelectorAll (modern way).

Changing Content

textContent, innerHTML, innerText.

Change attributes with setAttribute, getAttribute.

Change styles with .style.

âœ… Practice:

Change text on button click.

Swap an image source dynamically.

ðŸŒ¿ Phase 2: Events & Interaction (Intermediate)

ðŸ‘‰ Goal: Make your page interactive.

Event Listeners

addEventListener, event types (click, mouseover, keydown, etc.).

Event object (event.target, event.preventDefault).

Event Bubbling & Delegation

Capturing vs bubbling.

Delegate events to parent elements for performance.

Forms

Input values with .value.

Validate and submit forms with JS.

âœ… Practice:

Create a form that validates input before submitting.

Build a simple to-do list (add, edit, delete items).

ðŸŒ³ Phase 3: DOM Manipulation (Advanced Basics)

ðŸ‘‰ Goal: Dynamically create, modify, and remove elements.

Creating & Removing

createElement, append, appendChild, prepend.

remove, removeChild.

insertBefore, replaceChild.

Class & Style Management

.classList.add/remove/toggle/contains.

Modify inline and external styles.

Traversing DOM

parentNode, children, firstChild, nextElementSibling.

âœ… Practice:

Drag-and-drop items between containers.

Accordion menu.

ðŸŒ² Phase 4: Advanced DOM (Pro Level)

ðŸ‘‰ Goal: Handle complex UI & performance.

DOM Performance

Minimize reflows/repaints.

Use DocumentFragment for batch operations.

Storage

LocalStorage & SessionStorage.

Save and restore DOM state.

Mutation Observer

Watch DOM changes dynamically.

Shadow DOM & Custom Elements

Basics of Web Components.

Encapsulation of styles.

âœ… Practice:

Build a note-taking app with localStorage.

Create custom modal, tabs, or dropdown.

Build a photo gallery with lazy loading.

ðŸŒ´ Phase 5: Mastery & Projects

ðŸ‘‰ Goal: Apply everything in real projects.

Project Ideas:

âœ… To-do list app (with localStorage).

âœ… Calculator (DOM events + dynamic updates).

âœ… Weather app (fetch API + DOM rendering).

âœ… Kanban board (drag & drop + storage).

âœ… Interactive quiz app.

ðŸ”‘ Tips to Master DOM

Always read the MDN docs for methods.

Start small but finish projects.

Learn Vanilla JS first before libraries (React, Vue).

Debug with console.log() and Chrome DevTools.

Try to recreate parts of real apps (Instagram feed, Trello board).
